## Changes Between 2.2.0 and 3.0.0 (July 20, 2024)

### Why the Major Version Bump?

This release adopts a new major version of Faraday and targets
only [community supported RabbitMQ versions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information),
which at this time means `3.13.x`.

While there are no major breaking changes in the library itself,
these two changes and more than two years that have passed since 2.0.0
warrant a major version bump.

### Support for Faraday 2.x

### Support for Management of Topic Permissions

Contributed by @bagedevimo.

GitHub issue: [#57](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/rabbitmq_http_api_client/issues/57)

### Upgraded Faraday Middleware

Faraday (a dependency) has been upgraded to `1.2.x` to eliminate some deprecation warnings.


## Changes Between 1.15.0 and 2.0.0 (May 21, 2021)

### Health Check Endpoint Changes

`RabbitMQ::HTTP::Client#aliveness_test` has been removed. The endpoint has been deprecated
in favor of [more focussed health check endpoints](https://www.rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html#health-checks):

``` ruby
c = RabbitMQ::HTTP::Client.new("http://username:s3kRe7@localhost:15672")

# Returns a pair of [success, details]. Details will be nil
# if the check succeeds.
#
# Checks for any alarms across the cluster
passed, details = c.health.check_alarms

# alarms on the given node
passed, details = c.health.check_local_alarms

# is this node essential for an online quorum of any quorum queues?
passed, details = c.health.check_if_node_is_quorum_critical

# do any certificates used by this node's TLS listeners expire within
# three months?
passed, details = c.health.check_certificate_expiration(3, "months")
```

See the list of methods in `RabbitMQ::HTTP::HealthChecks` to find out what other
health checks are available.

### User Tags Type Change

User tags returned by the `RabbitMQ::HTTP::Client#list_users` and `RabbitMQ::HTTP::Client#user_info`
methods are now arrays of strings instead of comma-separated strings.

Internally the method encodes both command-separated strings and JSON arrays in API responses
to support response types from RabbitMQ 3.9 and earlier versions.

See [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2676](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2676) for details.

## Changes Between 1.14.0 and 1.15.0 (February 16th, 2021)
### Content Length Detection Changes

When deserialising response bodies, the client now uses actual body length instead of
the value of the `content-length` header.

Contributed by Ryan @rquant Quant.

GitHub issue: [#49](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/rabbitmq_http_api_client/pull/49)


## Changes Between 1.13.0 and 1.14.0 (July 8th, 2020)

### URI.escape is No Longer Used

Deprecated `URI.escape` has been replaced with `Addressable::URI.escape_component`.
This introduces `addressable` as a new dependency.

### Dependency Bump

Note: Faraday will now raise a `Faraday::ResourceNotFound` instead of `Faraday::Error::ResourceNotFound`.

GitHub issue: [#45](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/rabbitmq_http_api_client/pull/45)

Contributed by Niels Jansen.

## Changes Between 1.12.0 and 1.13.0 (March 5th, 2020)

## Changes Between 1.10.0 and 1.11.0 (Dec 25th, 2018)

### effin_utf8 Dependency Dropped

This library no longer supports Ruby 1.8 and thus
doesn't need to depend on the `effin_utf8` gem.

Contributed by Luciano Sousa.


## Changes Between 1.9.0 and 1.10.0 (Nov 27th, 2018)

### Improved Resource Deserialisation

Bodies of responses with content length of 0 will no longer
be deserialised.

This improves compatibility with future versions of RabbitMQ
that will use Cowboy 2.7.0 or later, which doesn't include
the content-type header for blank responses (e.g. PUTs).


## Changes Between 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 (Oct 19th, 2017)

Spec files and development/CI scripts are no longer included into the gem.


## Changes Between 1.8.0 and 1.9.0 (July 30th, 2017)

Contributed by Mrinmoy Das.



## Changes Between 1.7.0 and 1.8.0 (Feb 1st, 2017)

### Correct URI Path Segment Encoding

URI path segment encoding (e.g. vhosts, queue names, etc)
in this client now correctly encodes spaces.

GitHub issue: [#28](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/rabbitmq_http_api_client/issues/28).



## Changes Between 1.6.0 and 1.7.0

### Blank Tags by Default

The `:tags` attribute is no longer required by `Client#update_user`. If not provided,
a blank list of tags will be used.


## Changes Between 1.5.0 and 1.6.0

### Definition Upload Support

The client now can upload definitions (of queues, exchanges, etc):

``` ruby
defs = {
        :queues => [{
          :name => 'my-definition-queue',
          :vhost => '/',
          :durable => true,
          :auto_delete =>  false,
          :arguments => {
             "x-dead-letter-exchange" => 'dead'
          }
        }]
      }.to_json

c.upload_definitions(defs)
```

Contributed by Pol Miro.



## Changes Between 1.4.0 and 1.5.0

### Ruby 1.8 Compatibility Restored

The library no longer uses 1.9-specific hash syntax.



## Changes Between 1.0.0 and 1.1.0

`RabbitMQ::HTTP::Client#queue_binding_info`,
`RabbitMQ::HTTP::Client#bind_queue`, and
`RabbitMQ::HTTP::Client#delete_queue_binding`
are new methods that operate on queue bindings:

``` ruby
c = RabbitMQ::HTTP::Client.new("http://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:15672")

c.bind_queue("/", "a.queue", "an.exchange", "routing.key")
c.queue_binding_info("/", "a.queue", "an.exchange", "properties.key")
c.delete_queue_binding("/", "a.queue", "an.exchange", "properties.key")
```

Contributed by Noah Magram.


## Changes Between 0.7.0 and 0.8.0

### Client#protocol_ports

`RabbitMQ::HTTP::Client#enabled_protocols` is a new method that returns
a hash of enabled protocols to their ports. The keys are the same as
returned by `Client#enabled_protocols`:

``` ruby
# when TLS and MQTT plugin is enabled
c.protocol_ports # => {"amqp" => 5672, "amqp/ssl" => 5671, "mqtt" => 1883}
```

### Client#enabled_protocols

`RabbitMQ::HTTP::Client#enabled_protocols` is a new method that returns
a list of enabled protocols. Some common values are:

 * `amqp` (AMQP 0-9-1)
 * `amqp/ssl` (AMQP 0-9-1 with TLS enabled)
 * `mqtt`
 * `stomp`

``` ruby
# when TLS and MQTT plugin is enabled

  client_cer: ...,
  client_key: ...,
  ca_file:    ...,
  ca_path:    ...,

})
```

Any options other than `username` and `password` will be passed on to
`Faraday::Connection`.

it possible to access the URI a client instance uses.


## Changes Between 0.3.0 and 0.4.0

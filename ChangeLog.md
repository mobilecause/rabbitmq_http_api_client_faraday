### Definition Upload Support

The client now can upload definitions (of queues, exchanges, etc):

``` ruby
defs = {
        :queues => [{

          :vhost => '/',
          :durable => true,
          :auto_delete =>  false,
          :arguments => {
             "x-dead-letter-exchange" => 'dead'

c.bind_queue("/", "a.queue", "an.exchange", "routing.key")

```

### Client#enabled_protocols

 * `amqp/ssl` (AMQP 0-9-1 with TLS enabled)
 * `mqtt`
 * `stomp`

``` ruby

  client_cer: ...,
  client_key: ...,
  ca_file:    ...,
  ca_path:    ...,

})
```

Any options other than `username` and `password` will be passed on to
`Faraday::Connection`.
